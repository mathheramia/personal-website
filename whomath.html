    <h3>
    Short & Sweet
    </h3>

    <p>
    Name is Math Heramia (yes Math like the subject- nothing more, nothing less) I was born/raised in the SF Bay Area and I'm currently an undergrad student studying Business at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business and Media Studies at UC Berkeley.
    </p>

    <h3>
    Interests
    </h3>

    <p>
    <li>Finance: The news cycle is constant and it gives a forensic lense into understanding how businesses succeed or fail</li>
    <li>Technology: Growing up in Silicon Valley it's cemented itself in the back of my mind plus its ability to constantly evolve and address new challenges for businesses, individuals, and society as a whole fascinates me.</li>    
    <li>Media: Whether it be entertainment or the news, media is the perfect proxy for the common person's attention and as someone who wants to have an impact it's important to have a stake in it</li>
    <li>Politics: It's the medium that orchestrates change (or lack thereof) for not only the 333 million Americans like myself but the billions accross the globe</li>
    <li>Management Consulting: No other job with the mix of working with uppermanagement of F500 companies and immense impact through transformations (plus the free travel doesn't hurt)</li>
    <li>Tech Investment Banking: Similair to Management Consulting the impact is immense with the ability to work on debt or capital raises for tech companies which is the intersection of my interests (hours are worse though)</li>
    <li>Venture Capital: I'm drawn to this "casino of finance" where you're guaranteed losses with a few big wins and the opportunity to work with innovative projects (that change society for the better) with the most brilliant people</li>
    <li>Buyout Private Equity: House flipping but except some boomer's first home switch it out for a company with thousands of employees (basically I like the applied finance portion and impact again- I think we're forming a pattern here)</li>
    </p>

    <h3>
    Philosophy
    </h3>

    <p>
    Effective altruism - I'm not only in a privileged position to take on immense risk but also have the characteristics to "make a difference" (I know cringe but like unironically what I think). So why not take the risk and hopefully have an impact on those who truly need help because if I was in their position I would want someone who was capable to take the chance to do it for me. I've taken on EA because it essentially encapsulates a nice idea of making as much money (proxy for impact) as possible and giving it away to those who need it.
    </p>

    <h3>
    <2 year goals

    <li>Accepted at a deferred M7 (preferably Stanford GSB) MBA program</li>
    <li>Accepted into YC</li>
    <li>Raise $10 million for my quant hedge fund</li>

    <p>
    <li>Forbes 30 Under 30 (except the fraud/prison part)</li>

    </p>

    <h3>
      End goal
      </h3>

    <h3>
